# js-blacklist

A basic list of known hosts that have historically served annoying and/or naughty JavaScript.

## What is this for?

For use with browser extensions such as [JavaScript Blacklist](https://code.google.com/archive/p/jsblacklist/downloads) for Safari and *[whatever people are using]* on Chrome.

## Who made this?

[Jason Cosper](https://twitter.com/boogah/) put it all together and adds new entries. A significant number of entries are courtesy of [John Gruber](https://gist.github.com/gruber/f7d2a569b3fb51d48a89) and [Nick Heer](http://pxlnv.com/miscellanea/javascript-blacklist/).

## How can I add a host to this list?

[Pull Requests](https://github.com/boogah/js-blacklist/pulls) are always welcome.

**Note:** Please submit your changes to both the `multi-line` and `single-line` versions of the file, in proper alphabetic order. Changes that do not follow this simple rule *will* be rejected.

If you're not comfortable with forking things in GitHub and making the necessary changes, you can open up an [Issue](https://github.com/boogah/js-blacklist/issues). However, please keep in mind that Issues probably won't be dealt with as quickly as a Pull Request would be.
